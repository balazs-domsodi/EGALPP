This program is an improved metaheuristic algorithm for exercise generation. It is designed to address the widely recognized problem of generating diverse exercises to measure studentsâ€™ knowledge on various topics. The algorithm generates more subsets of tasks in such a way that the quality of these subsets should be good enough according to a predefined quality matrix. The difficulty values of these subsets should also be equal.

# Steps to take before running the program

The textual content of the tasks, their difficulty values, and the value expressing the preference for joint inclusion taken in pairs (coexistence preferences) must be located in the databank folder. Any number of such files can be created with the extension txt.

It is necessary to build these files line by line, where each line expresses the properties of a task, and individual properties are separated by a tab character. The first value is the textual content of the task (essentially the task itself), the second value is its difficulty value on a scale of 1-5, and the last value is the values expressing the coexistence preferences taken with previous tasks, separated by semicolons, on a scale of 0-10, where 0 means prohibiting the inclusion of the two task pairs together. In the file, the coexistence preference value of the first line plays a placeholder role, its value has no significance, it can be entered as desired in the range 0-255 - its existence serves the purpose that the values of the coexistence preferences are indexed in the same way as the other properties of the task queues, since otherwise the first element would not have such a value, since there is no value expressing a common inclusion preference related to the elements preceding it. An example of this input file is databank/test.txt.
